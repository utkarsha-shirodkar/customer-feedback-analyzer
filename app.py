"""
The frontend: a Streamlit dashboard for a business owner.

Paste customer reviews (one per line), click Analyze, and see the results.
This app does NOT call Gemini directly. It calls OUR OWN backend (api.py),
exactly the way we called external APIs in Lesson 9.

Run it (in a SECOND terminal, while api.py is also running):
    uv run streamlit run app.py
